# [Dynamics](@id dynamics)
In between runs of the [linear goal program](@ref lgp), the [dynamic parameters](@ref dynamic-param-vars) and [intermediate variables](@ref intermed-vars) are updated. After the dynamic parameters have been updated, the [linear goal program](@ref lgp) is run for the subsequent year.

In the equations below, a subscript ``+1`` indicates the next-year's value, and a subscript ``-1`` the previous year's value. An underline indicates an [exogenous parameter](@ref exog-param-vars), while an overline is a [dynamic parameter](@ref dynamic-param-vars).

## [Prices](@id dynamics-prices)
For an explanation of the different prices, see the explanation in [About demand-led growth](@ref demand-led-growth-prices).

World prices grow at an exogenously specified inflation rate ``\underline{\pi}_{w,k}``,
```math
    \overline{p}_{w,k,+1} = \left(1 + \underline{\pi}_{w,k}\right)p_{w,k}.
```
By default, a uniform inflation rate is applied to all traded goods, while the real price is constant, so that ``\underline{\pi}_{w,k} = \underline{\pi}_w``. However, optionally, a real price index for an individual product ``k`` can be specified: see [World real price trends for selected tradeables](@ref params-optional-price-trend).

The output price level is given by
```math
    \overline{P}_{g,+1} = \left(1 + \pi_g\right)\overline{P}_g,
```
where the inflation rate ``\pi_g`` is given by the averge of the rate of increase in basic prices, weighted by domestic supply,
```math
    \pi_g = \frac{\sum_{k = 1}^{n_p} q_{s,k}\pi_{b,k}}{\sum_{k = l}^{n_p} q_{s,l}}, \quad \pi_{b,k} = \frac{p_{b,k}-p_{b,k,-1}}{p_{b,k,-1}}.
```

The inflation rate ``\pi_F`` of final domestic demand is the average of the rate of increase of basic prices weighted by the value of final domestic demand,
```math
    \pi_F = \frac{\sum_{k = 1}^{n_p} F_k\pi_{b,k}}{\sum_{k = l}^{n_p} F_l}.
```

The GDP inflation rate ``\pi_\text{GDP}`` is the average of the rate of increase of basic prices weighted by the value of total final demand. It is calculated as
```math
    \pi_\text{GDP} = \frac{\sum_{k = 1}^{n_p} V_k\pi_{b,k}}{\sum_{k = l}^{n_p} V_l},\quad V_k = \overline{p}_{b,k,-1}\left(F_k + X_k + I_k - M_k\right).
```

Basic prices are a weighted average of domestic and foreign prices, with the weight given by the import fraction ``f_k``, where
```math
    f_k = \frac{M_k}{q_{d,k} + F_k + I_k}.
```
Basic prices are therefore
```math
    \overline{p}_{b,k} = f_k \underline{e}p_{w,k} + \left(1 - f_k\right)p_{d,k}.
```
If ``f_k = 1``, meaning the country does not produce product ``k`` and all supply is from imports, then ``\overline{p}_{b,k} = \underline{e}p_{w,k}``. Otherwise, domestic prices are set as a mark-up on costs, where costs are in terms of basic prices
```math
 p_{d,k} = \sum_{i = 1}^{n_s} \underline{\mu}_i\underline{S}_{ik}
    \left[
        \overline{P}_g\left(\omega_i + \varepsilon_i\right) + \sum_{l = 1}^{n_p} \overline{p}_{b,l} \overline{D}_{li}
    \right].
```
In this equation, ``\omega_i`` is the wage share for sector ``i`` and ``\varepsilon_i`` is the energy share.

Taken together, the equations above lead to a linear system in domestic prices,
```math
p_{d,k} = \overline{P}_g\sum_{i = 1}^{n_s} \underline{\mu}_i\underline{S}_{ik}\left(\omega_i + \varepsilon_i\right) + \underline{e}\sum_{l = 1}^{n_p} A_{kl} f_l \overline{p}_{w,l} + \sum_{l = 1}^{n_p} A_{kl} \left(1 - f_l\right)\overline{p}_{d,l},
```
where
```math
    A_{kl} = \sum_{i = 1}^{n_s} \underline{\mu}_i\underline{S}_{ik}\overline{D}_{li}.
```
This system is solved by Macro using linear algebra.

## [Imports](@id dynamics-imports)
The normal level of imports of good ``k`` as a fraction of domestic demand (intermediate, final, and investment) is updated based on the values calculated in the last run of the [linear goal program](@ref lgp), and then adjusted based on relative changes in world and domestic prices,
```math
\overline{f}_k = f_k \left(\frac{1 + \pi_{d,k}}{1 + \underline{\pi}_{w,k}}\right)^{(1 - f_k)\underline{\phi}^\text{imp}_k},\quad f_k = \frac{M_k}{q_{d,k} + F_k + I_k}.
```
Note that when ``\pi_{d,k}`` and ``\underline{\pi}_{w,k}`` are much smaller than one, this is approximately equal to
```math
\overline{f}_k \approxeq f_k + f_k\left(1 - f_k\right)\underline{\phi}^\text{imp}_k \left(\pi_{d,k} - \underline{\pi}_{w,k}\right).
```
In this formulation, the parameter ``\underline{\phi}^\text{imp}_k`` is seen to be an Armington elasticity[^1] of substitution between domestic products and imports. The factor ``f_k\left(1 - f_k\right)`` arises because the elasticity is applied to the import share rather than to imports and domestic products separately.

The reference import demand, which appears as a scale factor in the [linear goal program](@ref lgp), is set equal to twice the calculated volume of imports,
```math
\overline{M}^\text{ref}_k = 2 M_k.
```
The multiple of two is somewhat arbitrary, because this simply sets a scale.

[^1]: Armington elasticities play an important role in trade models, but estimates very widely, and are mainly available for high-income countries. As a general rule, long-run elasticities (e.g., annual) are larger than short-run elasticities (e.g., monthly), and estimates tend to increase with the level of disaggregation of the data. Different statistical models can give very different results (e.g., estimates from systems of supply-demand equations tend to be about twice as large as estimates based on demand alone). If possible, find estimates for the country where Macro is being applied and at a similar level of disaggregation.

## [Wages and labor productivity](@id dynamics-wages-labor-prod)
The wage share ``\omega_i`` in sector ``i`` is given by
```math
\omega_i = \frac{W_i}{g_i}.
```
The wage bill ``W_i`` is by definition equal to the wage rate ``w_i`` multiplied by sectoral employment ``L_i``, while output ``g_i`` is by definition equal to real labor productivity ``\lambda_i`` muliplied by the price level of output ``\overline{P}_g`` and sectoral employment. So, the wage share can also be written as
```math
\omega_i = \frac{w_i L_i}{\overline{P}_g\lambda_i L_i} = \frac{1}{\overline{P}_g}\frac{w_i}{\lambda_i}.
```
In the Macro model, labor productivity is assumed to rise with economic growth, following the Kaldor-Verdoorn law[^2]. While Kaldor-Verdoorn coefficients are observed to differ between sectors -- for example, with a higher responsiveness in industry than services -- data are limited. For that reason, the Macro model calculates the growth rate of economy-wide average labor productivity, ``\hat{\lambda}``, which is applied to labor productivity in each sector,
```math
\hat{\lambda}_i = \hat{\lambda} = \underline{\alpha}_\text{KV} \hat{Y} + \underline{\beta}_\text{KV}.
```
The growth rate of total employment, ``L``, is then given (using a standard approximation) by the difference in growth rates of output and productivity,
```math
\hat{L} = \hat{Y} - \hat{\lambda} = \left(1 - \underline{\alpha}_\text{KV}\right)\hat{Y} - \underline{\beta}_\text{KV}.
```

Wages are observed to rise in a tight labor market and fall otherwise. That behavior is captured in the model through a "conflict" mechanism, which views nominal wage changes as a consequence of bargaining between parties with unequal and shifting bargaining power -- employers and employees. The real wage is assumed to rise faster than labor productivity when employment growth is higher than working-age population growth ``\hat{\underline{N}}`` (an exogenous [time series](@ref params-time-series) parameter), with a proportionality factor ``\underline{k}``, and fall otherwise. The nominal wage is then equal to the real wage adjustment plus an inflation pass-through (or wage indexation) parameter ``\underline{h}`` multiplied by the final domestic demand inflation rate. As with labor productivity, a common growth rate ``\hat{w}`` is applied in each sector,
```math
\hat{w}_i = \hat{w} = \underline{h}\pi_F + \hat{\lambda}\left[1 + \underline{k}\left(\hat{L} - \hat{\underline{N}}\right)\right].
```

With the above expressions, the growth rate of the wage share can be calculated,
```math
\hat{\omega}_i = \hat{w} - \hat{\lambda} - \pi_g.
```
[^2]: The [Kaldor-Verdoorn law](https://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences/applied-and-social-sciences-magazines/verdoorns-law) states that the growth rate of labor productivity is an increasing function of the growth rate of output. In its original form it applies only to manufacturing, and the influences are weaker in services and agriculture. In the Macro model, an economy-wide labor productivity rate is specified as an increasing function of the GDP growth rate.

## [Intermediate demand coefficients](@id dynamics-intermed-dmd-coeff)
By default, intermediate demand coefficients are kept at their initial values: ``\overline{D}_{ki} = \underline{D}^\text{init}_{ki}``. However, optionally, they can be endogenized through a cost share-induced technological change mechanism[^3]. The growth rates of the coefficients are calculated as
```math
\hat{\overline{D}}_{ki} = C_{ki} - \frac{\underline{a}\alpha_{ki}}{\sqrt{\sum_{l=1}^{n_p} \alpha^2_{li}}},
```
where the ``C_{ki}`` are constants, set such that ``\hat{\overline{D}}_{ki} = 0`` initially, ``\underline{a}`` is a rate constant, which is specified in the [configuration file](@ref config-intermed-dmd-change), and the ``\alpha_{ki}`` are cost shares, which are calculated consistent with the calculation of [prices](@ref dynamics-prices).

[^3]: The equation shown here is a simplified application of a more general model that is presented in [_Cost Share-induced Technological Change and Kaldorâ€™s Stylized Facts_](https://www.sei.org/publications/cost-share-induced-technological-change-kaldors-stylized-facts/) by Eric Kemp-Benedict.

## Profit rate
Profitability is reflected in the sector profit rate at full utilization ``r_i``, which is defined as profit divided by the value of capital. Gross profit per unit of output, ``\Pi_i``, is given by the value of output per unit of output less unit costs,
```math
\Pi_i = \frac{1}{g_i}\sum_{k=1}^{n_p} \underline{S}_{i,k} q_{s,k}p_{x,k} -
        \left[\overline{P}_g\left(\omega_i + \varepsilon_i\right) +
              \sum_{k = 1}^{n_p}\overline{p}_{b,k}\underline{D}_{k,i} \right].
```
Basic prices are used on the cost side of this equation, while an export-weighted price ``p_{x,k}`` is used on the revenue side, where
```math
p_{x,k} = \frac{X_k}{q_{s,k}} \underline{e}p_{w,k} + \left(1 - \frac{X_k}{q_{s,k}}\right)p_{d,k}.
```

The Macro model does not track the capital stock. Instead, it tracks potential output, which is related to the capital stock through a sector-specific capital-output ratio. The calculation for the profit rate starts with the current unit price of capital goods ``p_K``, calculated as
```math
p_K = \sum_{k=1}^{n_p}\underline{\theta}_k p_{d,k}.
```
The profit rate is then given by profits divided by the product of the price of capital and the capital-output ratio ``\underline{v}_i``,
```math
r_i = \frac{\Pi_i}{p_K\underline{v}_i}.
```
Capital-output ratios are initialized using a procedure described below in [Demand for investment goods](@ref dynamics-inv-dmd).

## [Investment & potential output](@id dynamics-potential-output)
Net potential output in sector ``i`` (that is, accounting for depreciation) grows at a rate ``\gamma_i``. Unless it is overridden by an [optional exogenous potential output](@ref config-optional-input-files), the value is determined endogenously by an investment function that responds to utilization, profitability, and borrowing costs (proxied by the central bank lending rate). The model assumes no active disinvestment, so the net growth rate is not allowed to fall below (the negative of) the depreciation rate,
```math
\gamma_i = \max\left[\gamma_{i0} + \underline{\alpha}_\text{util}\left(u_i - 1\right) +
           \underline{\alpha}_\text{profit}\left(r_i - \underline{r}^*\right) -
           \underline{\alpha}_\text{bank}\left(i_b - \underline{i}^\text{init}_{b0}\right),
           -\underline{\delta}_i\right].
```
The first term ``\gamma_{i0}`` is "autonomous investment". It represents long-run expectations. The other terms make up "induced investment" due to short-term changes in utilization, profits, and borrowing costs.

The target value for utilization is full utilization, ``u_i = 1``, while for the bank rate it is the initial value for the neutral bank rate that enters the Taylor function, ``\underline{i}^\text{init}_{b0}`` (see below). The target for the profit rate, ``\underline{r}^*``, is calculated by Macro during an internal calibration step to be consistent with starting values for investment and profits, using a procedure described below in [Demand for investment goods](@ref dynamics-inv-dmd).

If potential output is specified exogenously through the variable ``\underline{z}_i^\text{exog}``, then 
```math
\gamma_i = \underline{z}_{i,+1}^\text{exog}/\underline{z}_i^\text{exog} - 1.
```

Potential output grows at the calculated rate,
```math
\overline{z}_{i,+1} = \left(1 + \gamma_i\right)\overline{z}_i.
```
Autonomous investment follows adaptive expectations, with an initial value ``\gamma_{i0} = \underline{\gamma}_0``,
```math
\gamma_{i0,+1} = \gamma_{i0} + \underline{\xi}\left(\gamma_i - \gamma_{i0}\right).
```

## [Central bank lending rate](@id dynamics-taylor-rule)
The central bank lending rate is updated through a Taylor rule of the form
```math
i_b = i_{b0} + \underline{\rho}_Y\left(\hat{Y} - \hat{Y}^*\right) + \underline{\rho}_\pi\left(\pi_F - \underline{\pi}^*\right).
```
In Taylorâ€™s original paper, the coefficients were ``\underline{\rho}_Y = \underline{\rho}_\pi = 0.5``, but they can be set by the user in the [configuration file](@ref config-taylor-rule). Other parameters include initial, minimum, and maximum values for ``i_{b0}``, the target inflation rate ``\underline{\pi}^*``, and a permissible band for the target GDP growth rate, ``[\hat{\underline{Y}}^*_\text{min},\hat{\underline{Y}}^*_\text{max}]``.

The initial value for the target GDP growth rate is the initial value for the autonomous investment rate, ``\hat{Y}^* = \gamma_{i0}``. It adjusts through adaptive expectations, with the same rate of adaptation as for autonomous investment, while keeping within the user-specified band,
```math
\hat{Y}^* = \min\left\{\hat{\underline{Y}}^*_\text{max}, \max\left[\hat{\underline{Y}}^*_\text{min},
                       \hat{Y}^* + \underline{\xi}\left(\hat{Y} - \hat{Y}^*\right)\right]\right\}.
```

The neutral interest rate ``i_{b0}`` can also adjust, depending on the nominal exchange rate ``\underline{e}``. A target level ``i^*_{b0}`` is calculated as a function of the nominal exchange rate relative to its initial value ``\underline{e}/\underline{e}_0``:
```math
    i^*_{b0} = \underline{i}^\text{min}_{b0} + \frac{\underline{i}^\text{max}_{b0} - \underline{i}^\text{min}_{b0}}{1 + a_\text{xr}(\underline{e}/\underline{e}_0)^{\underline{b}_\text{xr}}},\quad a_\text{xr} = \frac{\underline{i}^\text{max}_{b0} - \underline{i}^\text{init}_{b0}}{\underline{i}^\text{init}_{b0} - \underline{i}^\text{min}_{b0}}.
```
A example graph of this function is shown below for the case ``\underline{i}^\text{min}_{b0} = 0.01``, ``\underline{i}^\text{max}_{b0} = 0.10``, ``\underline{i}^\text{init}_{b0} = 0.04``. The neutral rate then moves towards the target as
```math
    i_{b0,+1} = i_{b0} + \frac{1}{\underline{T}_\text{xr}}\left(i^*_{b0} - i_{b0}\right).
```
To make the interest rate insensitive to the exchange rate, set ``\underline{b}_\text{xr} = 0``.

![Target neutral interest rate vs. exchange rate](assets/images/ib0_vs_XR_curve.svg)

## [Demand for investment goods](@id dynamics-inv-dmd)
Total next-period demand for investment goods ``\overline{I}_{+1}`` is given by three terms: 1) the sum across sectors of current potential output multiplied by the capital-output ratio and the gross rate of increase in potential output (the net rate plus the depreciation rate); 2) energy investment expenditure from LEAP ``\underline{I}_\text{en}``; 3) any other exogenous investment ``\underline{I}_\text{exog}`` (see [optional exogenous parameters](@ref optional-exog-param-vars) and the format for the [exogenous investment demand file](@ref params-optional-exog-investment)). That is,
```math
\overline{I}_{+1} = \sum_{i=1}^{n_s} \overline{z}_i \underline{v}_i \left(\gamma_i + \underline{\delta}_i\right) + \underline{I}_{\text{en},+1} + \underline{I}_{\text{exog},+1}.
```
The total is allocated across investment goods supply shares ``\underline{\theta}_k`` in the [linear goal program](@ref lgp-investment-goods-allocation).

Values for sectoral capital-output ratios ``\underline{v}_i`` and the target profit rate ``\underline{r}^*`` are calculated using the equation for investment demand combined with the expression for the profit rate. Rearranging the equation for the profit rate gives
```math
\underline{v}_i = \frac{\Pi_i}{p_K r_i}.
```
The calibration is carried out by assuming that all sectors have the same profit rate, and that it is the target profit rate, ``\underline{r}^*``, so that
```math
\underline{v}_i = \frac{\Pi_i}{p_K \underline{r}^*}.
```
Substituting this expression into the equation for investment demand and solving for ``\underline{r}^*`` gives
```math
\underline{r}^* = \frac{1}{p_K\overline{I}_{+1}}\sum_{i=1}^{n_s} \Pi_i \overline{z}_i \left(\gamma_i + \underline{\delta}_i\right).
```
The calibrated value for ``\underline{r}^*`` is found by setting ``\overline{z}_i = g_i`` and ``\gamma_i = \underline{\gamma}_0``. That value is then used to calculate capital-output ratios.

## [Export demand](@id dynamics-export-demand)
For most products, the normal level of export demand grows with global GDP (or gross world product, GWP) to a goods-specific elasticity, modified by the relative change in domestic and world prices,
```math
\overline{X}^\text{norm}_{k,+1} = \left(1 + \underline{\gamma}^\text{world}\right)^{\underline{\eta}^\text{exp}_k} \left(\frac{1 + \underline{\pi}_{w,k}}{1 + \pi_{d,k}}\right)^{\underline{\phi}^\text{exp}_k} \overline{X}^\text{norm}_k.
```
When potential output is exogenously specified, normal export demand is assumed to be supply-elastic -- that is, it more or less keeps pace with the change in potential output -- but still responds to relative prices and fluctuations in global GDP. Fluctuations in global GDP are calculated relative to a smoothed trend,
```math
\gamma^\text{world}_\text{smooth} = \gamma^\text{world}_{\text{smooth},-1} + \underline{\xi}\left(\underline{\gamma}^\text{world} - \gamma^\text{world}_{\text{smooth},-1}\right)
```
One complicating factor is that potential output is a characteristic of a sector, whereas export demand is for products. The connection is through the supply matrix. Defining a matrix
```math
    \Omega_{ik} = \frac{1}{g_i}S_{ik}q_{s,k},
```
potential production ``q_{s,k}^*`` of product ``k`` is given by
```math
    q_{s,k}^* = \sum_{i=1}^{n_s} z_i\Omega_{ik},
```
while the fraction ``f_k^\text{exog}`` of potential output of product ``k`` due to exogenously specified sector output is
```math
    f_k^\text{exog} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n_s}\underline{z}_i^\text{exog}\Omega_{ik}}{\sum_{i=1}^{n_s} z_i\Omega_{ik}}.
```
With these defintions, an extended expression for the change in the normal level of exports is given by
```math
\overline{X}^\text{norm}_{k,+1} = \left[1 + f_k^\text{exog}\left(\frac{q_{s,k,+1}^*}{q_{s,k}^*} - 1\right)\right] \left(\frac{1 + \underline{\gamma}^\text{world}}{1 + f_k^\text{exog}\gamma^\text{world}_\text{smooth}}\right)^{\underline{\eta}^\text{exp}_k} \left(\frac{1 + \underline{\pi}_{w,k}}{1 + \pi_{d,k}}\right)^{\underline{\phi}^\text{exp}_k} \overline{X}^\text{norm}_k.
```
When ``f_k^\text{exog} = 0``, this reduces to the default formula.

## [Final domestic demand](@id dynamics-final-dom-demand)
Normal final domestic demand grows with the real wage bill to a goods-specific elasticity. The next-period nominal wage bill in sector ``i`` is calculated using variables and parameters introduced above,
```math
\overline{W}_{i,+1} = \frac{1 + \hat{w}}{1 + \hat{\lambda}}\left(1 + \gamma_i\right)W_i.
```
The growth in the real wage bill is given by these factors, but corrected for final domestic demand inflation ``\pi_F``,
```math
\gamma^\text{wage} = \frac{1}{1 + \pi_F}\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n_s}\overline{W}_{i,+1}}{\sum_{j=1}^{n_s}\overline{W}_j} - 1.
```
The updated normal final domestic demand is then given by
```math
\overline{F}^\text{norm}_{k,+1} = \left(1 + \underline{\gamma}^\text{wage}\right)^{\underline{\eta}^\text{wage}_k}\overline{F}^\text{norm}_k.
```
