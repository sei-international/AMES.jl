AMES, the Adaptable Macroeconomic Extension for Sustainability analysis, is an economic extension to the Low Emissions Analysis Platform, [LEAP](https://leap.sei.org/). It can also be linked to other models.

The AMES model, which is written in [Julia](https://julialang.org/), provides economic drivers to LEAP. LEAP provides energy-related investment expenditure to AMES. The two models are run iteratively until they converge, which normally happens within 2-3 cycles.

Development of AMES is led by the [Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI)](https://www.sei.org/).
