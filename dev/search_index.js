It is offered as an improvement over simply entering economic drivers by hand. It is most useful in LEAP models that track energy investment costs. In that case, the investment expenditure (in LEAP) helps drive economic activity (in Macro), which then drives energy consumption (in LEAP). The LEAP-Macro plugin will iteratively solve LEAP and Macro until the results converge to within a user-specified tolerance.","category":"page"},{"location":"uses-limitations/","page":"Uses and limitations","title":"Uses and limitations","text":"The goal of making a reasonably flexible model entails some trade-offs.

Moreover, the terms of trade can change to the extent that the basket of imported or exported goods changes.

If international investors perceive the country as particularly risky, they may withdraw capital or choose to invest elsewhere.","category":"page"},{"location":"uses-limitations/","page":"Uses and limitations","title":"Uses and limitations","text":"While this is an important issue, policies to respond to rising debt or adverse current accounts movements differ between countries, and diverse actors influence the path the economy can take: the executive branch; the central  bank; domestic firms, financial institutions, and individual households; international portfolio investors; and foreign firms.","category":"page"},{"location":"uses-limitations/","page":"Uses and limitations","title":"Uses and limitations","text":"Because of the complexities, the Macro model does not try to estimate international debt and international investor response to debt and current account deficits. However, it does estimate and report the current account balance (for the non-energy economy) in a file called collected_variables_#.csv, where # is the model run number. The reported figures can be used to check the consistency of the scenario. If the balance is persistently negative and, in particular, if the deficit grows faster than GDP, that may contradict the implicit model assumption that international debt and current account deficits are not a problem.","category":"page"},{"location":"uses-limitations/#Sector-specific-employment","page":"Uses and limitations","title":"Sector-specific employment","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"uses-limitations/","page":"Uses and limitations","title":"Uses and limitations","text":"The Macro model calculates labor productivity and employment indices. They apply at the level of the whole economy, not for individual sectors. That choice was dictated by the highly uneven availability of employment data. However, labor productivity varies substantially between sectors, and as a result the capacity of sectors to absorb labor also varies considerably. If the Macro model indicates specific sectors are declining or expanding, then a more detailed employment analysis might be called for.","category":"page"},{"location":"uses-limitations/#Non-energy-strategic-investment","page":"Uses and limitations","title":"Non-energy strategic investment","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"uses-limitations/","page":"Uses and limitations","title":"Uses and limitations","text":"The LEAP-Macro model is designed to explore the macroeconomic implications of energy investment. A LEAP model will typically simulate different energy sector strategies, so LEAP-Macro captures the impact of strategic investment in the energy sector. In other sectors, investment is endogenous, based on profitability and capacity utilization. For that reason, the Macro model cannot represent strategic investment in non-energy sectors.","category":"page"},{"location":"troubleshoot/","page":"Troubleshooting","title":"Troubleshooting","text":"CurrentModule = LEAPMacro","category":"page"},{"location":"troubleshoot/#troubleshoot","page":"Troubleshooting","title":"Troubleshooting","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"calib/","page":"Calibrating the model","title":"Calibrating the model","text":"CurrentModule = LEAPMacro","category":"page"},{"location":"calib/#calib","page":"Calibrating the model","title":"Calibrating the model","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"prep-config/","page":"Preparing the configuration file","title":"Preparing the configuration file","text":"CurrentModule = LEAPMacro","category":"page"},{"location":"prep-config/#prep-config","page":"Preparing the configuration file","title":"Preparing the configuration file","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"demand-led-growth/","page":"About demand-led growth","title":"About demand-led growth","text":"CurrentModule = LEAPMacro","category":"page"},{"location":"demand-led-growth/#demand-led-growth","page":"About demand-led growth","title":"Demand-led growth","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"demand-led-growth/","page":"About demand-led growth","title":"About demand-led growth","text":"Resources on demand-led growth[1]","category":"page"},{"location":"demand-led-growth/","page":"About demand-led growth","title":"About demand-led growth","text":"[1]: https://www.e-elgar.com/shop/usd/the-economics-of-demand-led-growth-9781840641776.html The Economics of Demand-Led Growth by Mark Setterfield","category":"page"},{"location":"leap-macro-link/","page":"LEAP-Macro link","title":"LEAP-Macro link","text":"CurrentModule = LEAPMacro","category":"page"},{"location":"leap-macro-link/#leap-macro-link","page":"LEAP-Macro link","title":"LEAP-Macro link","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"leap-macro-link/","page":"LEAP-Macro link","title":"LEAP-Macro link","text":"The link between the LEAP energy model and the Macro economic model is shown in the diagram below.
