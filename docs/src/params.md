# [External parameter files](@id params)
External parameters that are specified for all products, all sectors, or over time, are supplied in three comma-separated variable (CSV) files in the `inputs` folder. The files provided with the Freedonia sample model have the names `product_parameters.csv`, `sector_parameters.csv`, and `time_series.csv`. However, the names are set in the configuration file's [general settings](@ref config-general-settings). That means that different external parameter files can be used for different scenarios.

!!! info "Comma-separated variable (CSV) files"
    CSV-formatted files are plain text files that can be viewed in a text editor. They can also be opened and modified in Excel, Google Sheets, or other spreadsheet program, which is a convenient way to edit them. 

## Product parameters
The product parameters file has the structure shown below, where ``n_p`` is the number of products. The first two columns are the product codes and product names. These should be in the same order as the products in the [supply-use tables](@ref sut).

The next two columns are numbers giving the initial elasticities for export demand (with respect to global GDP) and final demand (with respect to total wages). For details, see the page on [model dynamics](@ref dynamics-demand-fcns) and on the [configuration file](@ref config-longrun-demand-elast).

Elasticities can be estimated from historical data, although that requires knowledge of statistical methods. Otherwise, they can be drawn from reported estimates or from already existing economic models.

| `code`      | `name`       | `export_elast_demand0` | `wage_elast_demand0` |
|:------------|:-------------|-----------------------:|---------------------:|
| CODE1       | Name 1       |                   xe_1 |                 we_1 |
| CODE2       | Name 2       |                   xe_2 |                 we_2 |
| ...         | ...          |                    ... |                  ... |
| CODE``n_p`` | Name ``n_p`` |            xe_ ``n_p`` |          we_ ``n_p`` |

The corresponding [variables](@ref exog-param-vars) are:
  * `export_elast_demand0` : the initial value for ``\underline{\eta}^\text{exp}_k`` for product ``k``
  * `wage_elast_demand0` : the initial value for ``\underline{\eta}^\text{wage}_k`` for product ``k``

## Sector parameters
The structure of the sector parameters file is shown below, where ``n_s`` is the number of sectors. It contains only a single parameter for each sector, the depreciation rate. Where available, this can be calculated from national statistics. Otherwise, the `delta` parameter reported for the whole economy in the [Penn World Table](https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/productivity/pwt/) can be applied to each sector.

| `code`      | `name`       | `depr_rate` |
|:------------|:-------------|------------:|
| CODE1       | Name 1       |        dr_1 |
| CODE2       | Name 2       |        dr_2 |
| ...         | ...          |         ... |
| CODE``n_s`` | Name ``n_s`` | dr_ ``n_s`` |

The corresponding [variable](@ref exog-param-vars) is:
  * `depr_rate` : ``\underline{\delta}_i`` for sector ``i``

## Time series
The structure of the time series file is shown below. It contains several parameters: the world growth rate, the world inflation rate, the growth rate of the working-age population, the exchange rate, and parameters for the [labor productivity calculation](@ref dynamics-wages-labor-prod).

Scenarios for the world economic growth rate can be drawn from other studies, such as the [Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) database](https://tntcat.iiasa.ac.at/SspDb/dsd?Action=htmlpage&page=about). The working age growth rate can be calculated from national projections or the [UN Population Prospects database](https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/).

Other parameters have less well-established sources of estimates. The labor productivity parameters (the Kaldor-Verdoorn parameters `KV_coeff` and `KV_intercept`) might well be assumed constant, possibly estimated from historical data or drawn from studies such as [Estimating Kaldor-Verdoornâ€™s law across countries in different stages of development](https://www.anpec.org.br/encontro/2014/submissao/files_I/i9-0ed7d252394aed6039f6af0e4ed51fc6.pdf) by Guilherme Magacho. Assumptions regarding the world inflation rate and the exchange rate can be based on historical patterns, other modeling studies, or consultation with experts.

| `year` | `world_gr` | `world_infl_rate` | `working_age_gr` | `exchange_rate` | `KV_coeff` | `KV_intercept` |
|-------:|-----------:|------------------:|-----------------:|----------------:|-----------:|---------------:|
|    y_1 |      wgr_1 |             wir_1 |           wagr_1 |            xr_1 |      kvc_1 |          kvi_1 |
|    y_2 |      wgr_2 |             wir_2 |           wagr_2 |            xr_2 |      kvc_2 |          kvi_2 |
|    ... |        ... |               ... |              ... |             ... |        ... |            ... |
|  y_*N* |    wgr_*N* |           wir_*N* |         wagr_*N* |          xr_*N* |    kvc_*N* |        kvi_*N* |

The corresponding [variables](@ref exog-param-vars) are:
  * `world_gr` : ``\underline{\gamma}^\text{world}``
  * `world_infl_rate` : ``\underline{\pi}_{w,k}`` for sector ``k`` (but assumed to be the same for all products)
  * `working_age_gr` : ``\underline{\hat{N}}``
  * `exchange_rate` : ``\underline{e}``
  * `KV_coeff` : ``\underline{\alpha}_\text{KV}``
  * `KV_intercept` : ``\underline{\beta}_\text{KV}``
